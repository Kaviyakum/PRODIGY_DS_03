from textblob import TextBlob
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    return analysis.sentiment.polarity

tweets['polarity'] = tweets['text'].apply(analyze_sentiment)


**# Applying sentiment analysis to the dataset**

tweets['polarity'] = tweets['text'].apply(analyze_sentiment)
